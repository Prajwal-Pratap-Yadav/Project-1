SageMaker-IT-Domain-Expert
==========================

Project Overview
This repository hosts a proof-of-concept (POC) project titled "Introducing Generative AI with AWS," focusing on fine-tuning large language models using SageMaker. The project aims to equip students with advanced ML and LLM skills by developing a domain expert model tailored for a specific domain. Leveraging AWS tools, students train a language model capable of generating contextually relevant text responses. The project emphasizes rigorous evaluation, comparing the fine-tuned model against the original to validate effectiveness, serving as a resource for high-quality ML solutions.
==========================
Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to develop a domain expert model tailored for the Information Technology (IT) domain. The project employs advanced NLP techniques to train and deploy a large language model on AWS SageMaker, capable of generating informative and contextually relevant text responses in the IT domain.
==========================
Dataset
The dataset selected for this project focuses on challenges in ubiquitous data management within the IT domain. It includes discussions on various aspects such as mobility support, context awareness, support for collaboration, adaptivity, and user interaction within ubiquitous computing environments. This dataset serves as the training ground for fine-tuning the language model to become a domain expert in IT-related text generation.
==========================
Project Workflow
Dataset Selection:
A dataset relevant to the IT domain is selected, containing unstructured text discussing challenges and requirements in ubiquitous data management.
==========================
Environment Configuration:
An AWS SageMaker IAM Role is configured to provide necessary permissions for accessing AWS resources.
An AWS SageMaker Notebook Instance is set up for developing and running code.
A GPU instance (ml.g5.2xlarge) is requested for fine-tuning the language model.
==========================
Fine-tuning the Language Model:
The Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model is deployed on the AWS platform.
Python scripts are employed to fine-tune the model on the selected IT domain dataset, enhancing its understanding of domain-specific language and concepts.
==========================
Model Deployment:
The fine-tuned language model is deployed on SageMaker to make it accessible for inference.
==========================
Testing and Evaluation:
The deployed model is tested and evaluated for its responses to domain-specific knowledge and text-generation tasks relevant to the IT domain.
A comparative analysis is conducted between the fine-tuned model and the original model to assess performance improvements.
==========================
Technologies Used
Amazon SageMaker:
Utilized for building, training, and deploying machine learning models quickly.
